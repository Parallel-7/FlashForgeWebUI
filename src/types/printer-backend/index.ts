/**
 * @fileoverview Centralized export module for all printer backend type definitions.
 *
 * Aggregates and re-exports TypeScript types from printer-features and backend-operations modules.
 * Provides a single import point for all backend-related types including feature configurations,
 * operational interfaces, job management structures, and capability definitions. Used throughout
 * the application for type-safe printer backend interactions.
 *
 * Key export categories:
 * - Feature types: Camera, LED, filtration, material station configurations
 * - Operation types: Job management, G-code commands, status monitoring
 * - Model types: Printer model identifiers and capabilities
 * - Backend types: Initialization, events, and factory options
