/**
 * @fileoverview Types for per-job Spoolman consumption tracking on
 * material-station printers (Creator 5 series, AD5X with station).
 *
 * The firmware reports no per-tool usage, so consumption is estimated from the
 * slicer's per-filament data. The user picks a Spoolman spool for each tool
 * when they match materials for a job the app starts. That choice belongs to
 * that one job only: it is deleted when the job ends, so a later print never
 * uses stale spool choices. Nothing is remembered per slot or per printer,
 * because the loaded spools can change on the printer at any time.
 *
 * Invariants enforced by the consumers of these types:
 * - Only jobs the app started are tracked. No record means no deduction.
 * - Each job is deducted at most once: the record is removed before any
 *   Spoolman request is sent.
 * - Spoolman API failures never affect printing (log + UI hint only).
