/**
 * @fileoverview Types for estimate-based Spoolman consumption tracking on
 * material-station printers (Creator 5 series, AD5X with station).
 *
 * The firmware provides no per-tool usage over HTTP, so consumption for
 * station printers is ESTIMATED from per-filament slicer data captured at
 * upload time and deducted against the spool assigned to each slot when the
 * print reaches a terminal state (completed / cancelled / error).
 *
 * Invariants enforced by the consumers of these types:
 * - No estimate => no deduction (never split totals or guess density).
 * - Exactly-once deduction per job across all terminal paths.
 * - Spoolman API failures never affect printing (log + UI hint only).
